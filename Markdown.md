# Markdown Introduction
I am learning about **_Markdown_** in this lab
1. So far, I have learned that markdown is like HTML without the brackets.
2. You can have ordered and unordered lists  
- Double spaces work similarly to a line break
- Plus, minus, and asterisks are used for unordered lists

# Highlighting
Inline code is highlighted with `back-ticks`.

Blocks of code are highlighted with three back ticks at the beginning of the block and three at the end of it.

# Footnotes
Footnotes are useful for guiding to a reference [^1]
[^1]: The reference for footnote 1

Footnotes can also have names, but it will still render as a number [^name]
[^name]: Named footnote reference

# Tables
Tables | Less | Organized
--- | --- | ---
*in* | `markdown` | **but**
they | look | nice
*when* | they | render

# Blockquotes
> Blockquotes are denoted with ">"

# Inline HTML
Inline HTML can be used in markdown.
However, Markdown does not work in the same way in the HTML brackets.  When using HTML in Markdown, you must use HTML tags inside of the HTML block you are creating.

# Youtube Videos
You can link Youtube videos in HTML, or in markdown
